      q: "Who decides the price of courses, 1:1 sessions, and workshops?",
      a: "Courses, 1:1 sessions and workshops are created by instructors, and each instructor sets the price based on their content, curriculum and effort, so prices vary by offering.",
    },
    {
      category: "Pricing & Payments",
      q: "Can prices change after I purchase?",
      a: "No. The exact price is always shown in INR (₹) on the listing page before purchase and again on the checkout page before payment. The amount shown at checkout is the total payable. VartaLang may update prices for future enrollments, but price changes will never affect completed purchases.",
    },
    {
      category: "Pricing & Payments",
      q: "How are payments processed?",
      a: "Payments are collected by VartaLang and processed securely via Razorpay. We accept all major Indian payment methods including UPI (Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm), debit cards, credit cards, net banking, and digital wallets. All transactions are billed in Indian Rupees (INR, ₹).",

      category: "Live 1:1 Sessions",
      q: "How are live 1:1 sessions conducted and how do I receive the link?",
      a: "Live 1:1 sessions are conducted online via high-quality video conferencing. Once you book a session, the meeting link and preparation instructions are shared with you by email and displayed in your learner dashboard well before the session start time.",
    },
    {
      category: "Live 1:1 Sessions",
      q: "Can I reschedule a live 1:1 session?",
      a: "Yes. You can request a free reschedule or a full refund if requested at least 24 hours before the scheduled session. Cancellations within 24 hours, or a no-show by the student, are non-refundable. If the instructor cancels or does not attend, you receive a full refund or a free reschedule of your choice.",
    },
    {
      category: "Workshops",
      q: "How do online and offline workshops work?",
      a: "Workshops are cohort-based learning events. Online workshops are conducted virtually, and access links are emailed before the start. Offline workshops take place in-person at the specific venue and date stated on the listing page. Seats are limited to maintain high instructor interaction.",
    },
    {
      category: "Workshops",
      q: "What is the cancellation policy for workshops?",
      a: "For online workshops, you receive a full refund if cancelled at least 48 hours before the start. For offline (in-person) workshops, you receive a full refund if cancelled at least 72 hours before the start. If VartaLang or the instructor cancels or reschedules to a date you cannot attend, you receive a full refund.",
    },
    {
      category: "Refunds",
      q: "What is the refund policy for self-paced courses?",
      a: "For self-paced online courses, we offer a full refund if requested within 7 days of purchase and less than 20% of the course content has been accessed. After 7 days, or once 20% or more has been accessed, no refund is available.",
    },
    {
      category: "Refunds",
      q: "What if physical study material arrives damaged or defective?",
      a: "Physical study materials dispatched for workshops are eligible for a free replacement or refund if damaged, defective, or incorrect, provided you report it to support within 7 days of delivery with photos.",
    },
    {
      category: "Refunds",
      q: "How long does a refund take to reach my bank account?",
      a: "Once approved, refunds are processed via Razorpay back to your original payment method within 5 to 7 business days.",
